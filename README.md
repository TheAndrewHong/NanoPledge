# Nanopledge
Nanopledge is a 0% fee crowdfunding platform that leverages cryptocurrency as a means for people to fund campaigns without the need for expensive payment processing and credit card fees.

My team won Hophacks, Johns Hopkins hackathon, best blockchain hack with this. 

Instructions: 
- Open up the index.php file and create your own test campaign to recieve funds for your cause whether it be raising money for research or to support yourself as a content creator. 
- Play around with your own campaign page by clicking on "support this cause" to try out the Nano cryptocurreny's payment processor
- To donate in Nano, you need to buy the Nano coin on the Binance cryptocurrency exchange and send it over to a mobile wallet to pay by scanning a qr code.
